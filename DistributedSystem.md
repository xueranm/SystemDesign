# Distributed Systems

> “A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.”

Assume a node is a machine then

__Performance__

> Performance is the degree to which a software system or component meets its objectives for timeliness

Solution: Single high-end computer -> Two or more low-spec computers 

__Scalability__

> Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth

Solution: If use distributed system, can split and store the data in multiple computers and distribute the work

__Availability__

> Availability is the probability of a system to work as required, when required, during a mission

Solution: Redundancy, store data into multiple, redundant computers\

In summary, distributed system is the solution for all above
